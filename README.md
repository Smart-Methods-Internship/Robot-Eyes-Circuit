# Robot-Eyes-Circuit

Simulated in TinkerCad

Robot eyes can be used for lighting purposes and also as an indication of the robot being powered on/off.

2 LEDs were used as the robot eyes in this circuit. The LEDs were connected in series so that the eyes can open together and shut together.

1-The components used were a breadboard, 2 capacitors, 1 transistor, 1 resistor, 1 potentiometer, 2 LEDs, and 3 of 1.5V batteries.
2-Connected the two terminals of the first capacitor with the positive and ground pins in the breadboard.
3-Connected the terminal 1 of the first capacitor with the emitter pin in the transistor.
4-Connected the collector pin of the transistor with the terminal 1 of the resistor.
5-Connected the base pin in the transistor with the terminal 2 of the resistor.
6-Connected the terminal 2 of the resistor with terminal 1 in the potentiometer.
7-Connected terminal 2 and the wiper pin in the potentiometer with the ground in the breadboard
8-Connected terminal 1 in the resistor with terminal 1 in the second capacitor.
9-Connected terminal 2 of the second capacitor with the ground in the breadboard.
10-Connected terminal 1 of the second capacitor with the anode of the first LED.
11-Connected the cathode of the first LED with the anode of the second LED.
12-Connected the cathode of the second LED with the ground in the breadboard.
13-Connected the poitive pin of the batteries with the positive pin in the breadboard and the negative pin with the ground pin in the breadboard.
14-Simulated the circuit.
